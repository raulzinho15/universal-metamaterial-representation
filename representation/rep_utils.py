    edge_params: nd.array or None
        A 2D numpy array containing the edge parameters to be assumed in the
        regression. The ordering should be that of the edge between the nodes with:
        1) The lowest and second lowest index in the metamaterial.

        All these nodes index orderings are relative to the nodes
        themselves, i.e., not relative to all nodes in the metamaterial.

        points, formatted in the way that the Metamaterial class
        `face_params` value should be for a particular face.
        
        If `edge_params` is `None`, then this also returns the edge
        parameters, where the first row in the returned array contains
        the face parameters, and the remaining three rows are the
